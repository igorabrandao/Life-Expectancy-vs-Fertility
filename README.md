### Overview ###

During the last fifty years, we have seen the gradual increase in life expectancy and the corresponding decrease in fertility rates worldwide. This is clearly the case of countries like China, India, the United States, Brazil, Japan, and Gabon, where dramatic improvements can be seen. On the other hand, countries like Russia, South Africa and Afghanistan, show moderate improvement.

Taking it in consideradion, we used Python, Bokeh charts and Jupyter tool to analyse this mass of data and get insights such as:

[UPDATE]
- How much CO² each manifacturer emits?
- Which fuel type is more ecologically sustainable?
- The engine capacity implies directly in its pollution emission?

### Crew ###

* Igor A. Brandão
* Leandro Antonio F. da Silva

### How to use ###

1. Download the *LifeExpectancy_x_Fertility.ipynb*, *gapminder_tidy.csv* files and put it in the same folder. 
2. After that, use Jupyter notebook tool and access the directory with the files. Enjoy yourself! :)

### Final considerations ###

[UPDATE]
The experience of work with Python, bokeh charts and Anaconda/Jupyter notebook showed to us lots of possibilities to analyse large amounts of data and consequently have great insights about it. The next step is transform these statics visualizations into dynamic simulations, such as real time dashboards.
